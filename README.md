# Setup
The Python version used is __3.12.6__. The required packages are located in requirements.txt 

# Run
The main file (main.py) has to be run with a command line argument indicating which algorithm to run:
- __PI__ -> Policy Iteration
- __VI__ -> Value Iteration
- __MC__ -> Monte Carlo
- __SARSA__ -> TD Sarsa
- __QLEARNING__ -> Q-Learning

On top of that, a graph showing the __cumulative episode rewards__ for MC, Sarsa and Q-Learning can be generated by providing the command line argument "CUMU_REWARDS".

E.g., to run the script with Policy Iteration:

    python main.py PI

Upon running, relevant plots/diagrams will be shown, after which the simulation starts. The agent will move through the environment following its policy obtained through the selected algorithm. The program will close when the agent reaches the terminal state.

The simulation can be controlled with the following key binds:
- __P__: Toggle autoplay
- __R__: Reset environment to starting position

While the simulation __is in autoplay__:
- __+/-__: Increase/decrease autoplay simulation speed

While the simulation __is NOT in autoplay__:
- __Spacebar__: Move the agent one step (according to its policy)
- __Arrow keys__: Move the agent manually
